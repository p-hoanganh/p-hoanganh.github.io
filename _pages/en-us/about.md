Currently, I am doing a post-doc at the University of Toulon, mainly researching [the coordination of multiple robots in limited communication conditions](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-ASRO-0002). This research is financed by a defense research and innovation program in France.

I received my Ph.D. degree in **Robotics and Automation** from the [University of Toulon](https://ed548.univ-tln.fr/en/home/), France, in 2021. My thesis is **Coordination of Autonomous Underwater Systems Based on an Integrated Methodology in an Open-source Environment**. My PhD program financed by French Ministry of Education, France.<br>

My research interests include **Control**, **Navigation** and **Localization** for **Robotics**, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (**AUVs**), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (**UAVs**), and Applied of Machine Learning in Robotics.
