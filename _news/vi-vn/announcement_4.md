This article presents a comprehensive scenario for utilizing drones to search for victims during high-rise fires. Given the complexity and difficulty of accessing such environments, employing drones for rapid victim searches may significantly reduce rescue operation time. Specifically, we have devised a two-phase drone control scenario. In phase 1, the drone autonomously navigates to the target location, benefiting from Deep Learning technology to automatically avoid obstacles during its movement. In the second phase, we have introduced a scanning algorithm to assist the drone in systematically surveying the entire rescue and recovery area to locate victims. We have constructed a test scenario and assessed the results using AirSim simulation software.
