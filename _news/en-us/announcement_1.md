#### Abstact
A soccer robot is a complex team sport that requires coordinated decision-making and execution from multiple robots. The Dec-POMDP approach provides a natural framework for modeling and optimizing the decision-making processes of a robot soccer team, as it allows for the representation of uncertainty and coordination among multiple robots.
In this paper, we describe a model for a robot soccer team and study a specification of team behavior based on Dec-POMDP specialization.
